Arma Make
===

Arma Make is a build system for addons made for Arma 3. It is especially suited to large or modular projects which may need multiple build configurations, multiple subsets of modules signed with distinct keys, or other complex features. It relies on the official AddonBuilder from BI, included in Arma 3 Tools.

Arma Make is written in **Python 3**.


HOWTO
===
Copy make.py and make.cfg into the root of your addon workspace. It should look something like this:

	workspace\
	|-- module1\
		|-- config.cpp
		|-- init.sqf
    	|-- module2\
        	|-- config.cpp
    	|-- make.py
    	|-- make.cfg

Open a command prompt here and run:
		`python make.py help`


To build your addon:
		`python make.py`

A directory called 'release' will be created with your addon and all modules built inside it.

You should look through the make.cfg file and customize it to suit your project. Each option is explained in the example file.

To build a single module only:
		`python make.py module1`

If you need to rebuild everything, use:
		`python make.py force`

If you want to copy the build result to your Arma directory:
		`python make.py test`

When everything is ready, you can run:
		`python make.py release 0.1`
to automatically build and pack your addon.

You can also stack command line options:
		`python make.py force test release 0.1`

If you have multiple build targets defined in make.cfg, specify them at build time:
		`python make.py target AlternateBuild force test`
